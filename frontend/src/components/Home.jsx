            <h1>Welcom to the my first Python-React-Project!</h1>
            <p>In this project I implemented simple interface with the ability to search for films by keyword, by genre and year, by actor's name and search for actors by name, as well as top 10 queries. I also made a registration and authentication form. If the user is authorized, he has the ability to add / remove films to / from the favorites list, view the favorites list, and also the ability to delete an account.</p>
